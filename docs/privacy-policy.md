# EvoArc Browser Privacy Policy

*Last updated: September 17, 2025*

## Our Commitment to Privacy

EvoArc is built with privacy as its core principle. We believe your browsing data belongs to you and should stay on your device. This policy explains our approach to protecting your privacy and the design decisions we've made to ensure your data remains secure.

## Data Collection and Storage

### What We Collect

**We do not collect any personal data.** Period. EvoArc is designed to operate entirely locally on your device.

The only data stored is:
- Browser settings (locally on your device)
- Bookmarks (locally on your device)
- Browsing history (locally on your device)
- Downloaded files (in your chosen downloads folder)
- Ad blocking rules (locally cached on your device)

### Optional iCloud Sync

If you choose to enable iCloud sync:
- Your bookmarks and settings can be synced across your devices using your personal iCloud account
- This sync is handled entirely by Apple's iCloud infrastructure
- We never have access to this data
- The sync can be disabled at any time

## Data Usage and Processing

### Local Processing

All data processing happens locally on your device:
- Search suggestions
- Ad blocking and content filtering
- URL preloading
- Tab management
- History tracking

### Third-Party Services

The only external connections made are:
- Websites you choose to visit
- Ad blocking filter list updates (from public filter lists)
- Search suggestions (only when explicitly enabled and only to your chosen search engine)

## Privacy Features

### Ad and Tracker Blocking

- Built-in ad blocking using public filter lists
- All blocking rules are processed locally
- Filter lists are customizable
- Updates are only downloaded when requested

### Search Privacy

- Default to privacy-respecting search engines
- No search data is collected or stored by EvoArc
- Optional redirect protection for external searches

### Browser Engine Privacy

- WebKit (Safari) mode uses Apple's native privacy protections
- Chrome mode available for compatibility while maintaining privacy
- No telemetry or usage data is collected in either mode

## Your Rights and Control

You have complete control over your data:
- All data can be deleted through the iOS Settings app
- iCloud sync can be disabled at any time
- Ad blocking can be customized or disabled
- Search engines can be changed or customized
- Downloads location can be configured

## Data Security

### Local Storage

- All local data is protected by iOS/macOS system security
- Benefits from device encryption when enabled
- Protected by your device's security measures

### iCloud Sync Security

- Uses Apple's end-to-end encryption
- Protected by your Apple ID security
- No additional servers or services involved

## Children's Privacy

EvoArc does not knowingly collect any data from children. All privacy protections apply equally to all users, regardless of age.

## Changes to This Policy

We will update this Privacy Policy as needed to reflect app updates and feedback. When we make changes, we will:
- Update the "Last updated" date at the top of the policy
- Notify users through the app when significant changes are made
- Maintain previous versions in our GitHub repository

## Legal Compliance

EvoArc is designed to comply with:
